This is inspired by [same-purpose tool for macOS](https://github.com/rauchg/wifi-password) by [@rauchg](https://github.com/rauchg).

## How to use

**1. Install it**

First of all, install [PsGet](http://psget.net/) if you don't have it yet - it's awesome module manager for PowerShell:

```powershell
(new-object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psget/psget/master/GetPsGet.ps1") | iex
```

Now, you can easily install module itself:

```powershell
Install-Module WiFi-Password
```

**2. Use it:**

To get the password for the WiFi you're currently logged onto:

```powershell
Show-WiFiPassword
```

or just

```powershell
wifi-password
```

To get it for a specific SSID:

```powershell
$ wifi-password <ssid>
```

To list all the stored WiFi networks:

```powershell
Select-WiFi
```
